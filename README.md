Project: E-Commerce 
Title: WILLMELIA 
      Idea by: Perez, Sofia
      came from our names: WILL(william)Mel(Armel)Ia(sofIa)
      Inspired by my Ideals and dream business(which is sneaker shop)


History of work: we actually integrated previous project that was cancelled (Web development) but we used JSON and Storage there but in this case 
sir Jaymart told me to not use JSON or other external like... or something storage or backend... so we have to redo everything but the previous idea is still used.

Instructions: Create a responsive E-commerce website with basic navigation and user interface functionality. The site should have a clean layout and allow users to navigate between Home, Product, About, and Profile Settings pages. (No JSON and Storage to be used or any other backend)

this is to be followed:   Required Pages and Features	- 1.	Home Page (•	Welcoming banner or hero section, •	Featured products section (just a few cards),•	Navigation bar with links to all other pages.) 
2.	Product Page ( •	Display a list/grid of products, •	Each product card should show: (Product Image, Name, Price)
•	Add to Cart button, •	Place  )
3.	About Page (•	Brief introduction about the store, •	Mission, vision, or any backstory, •	Reference (link of pictures))
4.	Profile Setting (•	Simple form allowing the user to: (Profile Picture, Name, Contact Number, Email) •	Logout button (back to login))

About This Project
Willmelia is a simple online shopping website. Users can log in, browse products, add items to a cart, and buy them. After buying, they get a receipt popup that they can print.

Features
• User login and logout with confirmation.
• Profile page where users can edit their name, email, phone, address, and upload a profile picture.
• Product list with images, prices, and discounts.
• Add products to cart and remove or change quantities.
• Checkout popup that shows order details, shipping, and payment method.
• Receipt popup that shows the order and client info.
• Receipt can be printed and fits on one page.
• The receipt popup scrolls if there are many products.

Limitations
• No real backend or database — all data is stored only while using the website (no saving after closing).
• Price does not change based on different product sizes or options yet because of limited knowledge and time.
• Payment methods are just shown but not connected to real payment gateways. 
• No real user account management beyond login/logout (no password reset or registration).
• No email notifications or order tracking features.

How it works?
1. User opens the website and sees the login page.
2. User logs in with their username and password. (hard-coded only (username: cheese, password: kimbap)
3. After login, user sees the home page and go to product list and can browse items.
4. User adds products to the cart.
5. User goes to checkout, selects shipping and payment method.
6. User confirms the order.
7. A receipt popup shows the order details and client info.
8. User can print the receipt or close the popup.
9.User can edit profile info anytime.
10. User can log out when done.
